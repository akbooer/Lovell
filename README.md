# Lövell

Lövell is an application for **Electronically-Assisted Visual Astronomy**.

It is built on the [LÖVE 2D](https://love2d.org/) platform, using [Lua](https://www.lua.org/) as a scripting language running under [LuaJit](https://love2d.org/).

Lövell owes its existence to the amazing application [Jocular](https://github.com/MartinCooke/jocular), by @MartinCooke, and, to some extent, its successor, **Canisp**.

# Lövell

Lövell is an application for **Electronically-Assisted Visual Astronomy**.

It is built on the LÖVE 2D platform, using Lua as a scripting language running under LuaJit.

Lövell owes its existence to the amazing application **Jocular**, by @MartinCooke, and, to some extent, its successor, **Canisp**.
